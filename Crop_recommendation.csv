Depending on your irrigation setup, prepare either ridges and furrows or raised beds. Mix in about 25ï¿½30 tons of well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) per hectare for better soil fertility.In South India, plant from April to June, while in North India, the season is usually May to June. Choose healthy rhizomes weighing 25ï¿½30 grams and plant them 5ï¿½7 cm deep. Space them 45 cm apart for ridges (20ï¿½25 cm between plants) or 30ï¿½40 cm apart in beds. You'll need about 2000ï¿½2500 kg of rhizomes per hectare.Use FYM and apply NPK (60:50:120 kg/ha) in 2ï¿½3 split doses. Adding 5ï¿½10 grams of Trichoderma per pit can help prevent rot. After planting, mulch with 12ï¿½15 tons of green leaves or straw to retain moisture and control weeds. Water immediately after planting and every 7ï¿½10 days, ensuring good drainage. Weed at 30, 60, and 90 days, and earth up around 60 days. The crop matures in 7ï¿½9 months.
